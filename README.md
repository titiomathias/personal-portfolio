# My personal portfolio

<p>My portfolio made from absolute scratch with HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and Bootstrap.</p>

<p>As a full stack developer, I must be able to develop projects from absolute zero, and here is a project that I am doing from the design and front-end to the back-end to demonstrate some of the my skills (even though I'm not qualified as a Designer).</p>
